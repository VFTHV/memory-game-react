Memory Card Game, React.

  You can run this project at:
https://memory-cards-game-react.netlify.app/

This project was built when I was going through React-Redux course.
It was built without instructor's guidance.
This project allowed me to practice with React: props, state, lifecycle methods etc.
I also used plain JavaScript array and object methods which allowed me to build this game's logics.
